# update-with-node
NW.js app that uses Node to check for updates and update a git repository.

## To run
- Do a `bower update`.

- Enter a path to a git project you want to check/update in the config.json file.

- To run the app from the terminal, type in the path to the nwjs executable and then the path to the app:
      ```
      /Applications/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs /path/to/update-with-node
      ```
      

## Issues
- Might want it to handle errors with bower/npm update differently.
