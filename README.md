# update-with-node
NW.js app that uses Node to check for upgrades and upgrade a git repository.

## To run
- Do a `bower update`.

- To run the app from the terminal, type in the path to the nwjs executable and then the path to the app:
      ```
      /Applications/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs /path/to/update-with-node
      ```
      
- Enter a path to a git project you want to check/upgrade in the config.json file.

## Issues
- Does not yet inform the user when it is done updating.
